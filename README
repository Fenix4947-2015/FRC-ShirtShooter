# FRC Shirt Shooter Robot

!LAST UPDATED: 2023-05-23!

## Misc

This README explains in dept how the project is setup for the shirt shooter. The code is
fully in C++ and its primary source file is located under "Robot\src\main\cpp\Robot.cpp".

In this file is stored the "Robot" class which inherits important methods which are called
when starting different modes (TeleOp, auto etc). Only Teleop was setup. 

The mechanum controller is setup under a custom class which is initialized by passing the 
CAN talon motor ids in the following order: (0: top_left, 1: bottom_left,  2: top_right, 
3: bottom_right).
